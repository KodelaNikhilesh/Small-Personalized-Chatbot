Step 1: 
Import nltk
Import random
from nltk.chat.util Import Chat, reflections

Step 2:
Create you own chat line 
Example:
paris = [
    
    [r"my name is (.*)", ["Hello %1, how can I help you?"]],
    [r"hi|hello|hey", ["Hello!", "Hey there!", "Hi! How can I assist you?"]],
    [r"how are you", ["I'm just a bot, but I'm doing great! How about you?"]],
    [r"what is your name", ["I'm a chatbot, and I'm here to chat with you!"]],
    [r"where are you from", ["I'm from the digital world!"]],
    [r"what can you do", ["I can chat with you, answer simple questions, and make your day better!"]],
    [r"who created you", ["I was created by a developer who loves AI and Python!"]],
    [r"what is the weather like", ["I'm not connected to live weather data, but you can check a weather website!"]],
    [r"bye|goodbye", ["Goodbye! Have a great day!", "See you later!"]],
]

Step 3:
paris = [
    
    [r"my name is (.*)", ["Hello %1, how can I help you?"]]
]

chatbot = Chat(paris, reflections)

def main():
  print("Hi, I'm Chatbox. How can I assist you?")
  while True:
    user_input = input("You: ")
    response = chatbot.respond(user_input)
    print("Chatbot:", response)
    if user_input.lower() == 'quit':
      break

Step 4:
main() #run
Execute the step line by line
